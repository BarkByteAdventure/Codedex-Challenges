# The year is 2199... we have become an interplanetary species and can travel to other planets in the solar system! ðŸš€

# Create a weight conversion program that:

#    Asks the user what their Earth weight is (as a float).
#    Asks the user for a planet number (as an int).

# Then, use an if/elif/else statement to calculate the user's weight on the destination planet.

# To calculate the user's weight:
# destination weight=Earth weight Ã— relative gravity

# Number	Planet	Relative Gravity
#   1       Mercury	    0.38
#   2	    Venus   	0.91
#   3   	Mars	    0.38
#   4   	Jupiter 	2.53
#   5   	Saturn  	1.07
#   6   	Uranus  	0.89
#   7   	Neptune 	1.14

# If the user enters a planet number outside of 1 - 7, print a message that says 'Invalid planet number'.
